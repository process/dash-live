# dash-live
Live creation and transcoding of MPEG-DASH media streams

dash-live can be used for live-streaming any type of media to MPEG-DASH clients. Media is automatically converted into dash segments, meaning you can keep your files at rest in their standard format. This is intended for people want the ability to stream large libraries of videos without converting them all to DASH segments beforehand.

(This is experimental software. It's very hacky right now and will very likely fail on many files.)
